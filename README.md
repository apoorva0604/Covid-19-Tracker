Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world causing many deaths, many got recovered and many are still infected.
What if we know the actual statistics , number of what is happening around the world, so that we can work or take precautions accordingly.
 So as developers, what can I do to make the situation better? I thought of making an application which can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data.
 By knowing the data of infected recovered and deaths, it will help us to take the steps accordingly and also will help us to motivate that the number of being recovered
 is much more than deaths , so it can be cured. It will help awaken the people by showing the proper stats and help them to take the necessary steps.
 
 It is a Covid -19 tracker which is build using React JS  (Hooks, Material UI, Charts js).
 The data in this project is  fetched from the API and I have created cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts.
